### 🚀 About Me
I’m a highly motivated aspiring data analyst with a strong foundation in **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and data storytelling**. I thrive on uncovering hidden patterns, building accurate forecasts, and presenting insights in a way that non-technical stakeholders instantly understand and act upon.

What sets me apart:
- Obsessive about **data quality** and **attention to detail**
- Natural talent for **storytelling with data** – I don’t just show charts, I explain *why* they matter
- Proven ability to translate complex findings into **executive-level dashboards and recommendations**
- Self-driven learner: I taught myself Python, SQL, and Power BI through real-world projects while balancing a full-time role/studies
- Always asking: “How can this insight create value or save time/money?”
