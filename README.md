### About Me
I’m actively looking for my next full-time Data Analyst job.  
Even though I’m early in my professional journey, I already think and work like someone with 1–2 years of experience because I’m obsessed with getting things right and delivering value fast.

What recruiters tell me stands out:
- Extremely strong **attention to detail** and data quality
- Natural talent for **storytelling with data – my dashboards don’t just look good, they answer real business questions
- Always volunteer to present findings – I’m comfortable explaining insights to non-technical people
- Super fast learner – I pick up new tools and concepts in days, not weeks
- Proactive & ownership mindset – I treat every project data like it’s my own company’s money on the line
